  <strong>🚀 EnableLife: A Unified Healthcare & Disability Support Platform</strong><br/>
  <em>A The hub for medicine, doctors, and essential disability services in one place</em>
</p>

---

## 📖 Project Description
✨ **Problem Statement: A unified platform to connect people with disabilities to essential services, including medicine, surgical supplies, and professional healthcare bookings.

💡 **Proposed Solution: We transitioned the project from mock client-side data to a functional, modular Node.js/Express backend API, implementing secure authentication (JWT), increasing product stock to 500 across the inventory, and enabling real-time stock-checked order processing.

🎯 **Target Users / Use Cases: Concise: 

=> Users with Mobility Challenges: Who can easily order necessary surgical items (e.g., wheelchairs, crutches) and medications directly to their home.

=> Caregivers and Family Members: Who can efficiently book doctors, physiotherapy, or home nursing services on behalf of the patient.

=> Individuals Seeking Mental Health Support: Who can access and book sessions with counselors and psychologists online or in-person.

=> Patients Requiring Diagnostics: Who can book at-home lab tests (e.g., blood, sugar, thyroid tests) for convenience and manage their history.

=> Anyone Needing Daily Assistance: Who can book services for help with daily activities like mobility support, cleaning, or grocery runs.
