## 📖 Project Description
✨ **Problem Statement: A unified platform to connect people with disabilities to essential services, including medicine, surgical supplies, and professional healthcare bookings.  
💡 **Proposed Solution: We transitioned the project from mock client-side data to a functional, modular Node.js/Express backend API, implementing secure authentication (JWT), increasing product stock to 500 across the inventory, and enabling real-time stock-checked order processing.  
🎯 **Target Users / Use Cases: Concise: 

The platform serves individuals with disabilities and their caregivers, enabling easy access to medical supplies, professional healthcare, and daily living assistance.

Action-Focused: Anyone facing mobility or health challenges, including patients, caregivers, and family members, who need to book medical services and order specialized supplies from home.

Broadest: Individuals requiring convenient access to specialized services, including medicine, surgical goods, diagnostics, home nursing, and psychological counseling.
